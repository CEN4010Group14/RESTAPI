I wrote my first short story in third grade. I graduated with a BA from Goddard College in 1991 and then studied poetry for a year in the MFA in Writing Program at Vermont College. A poem turned into a story, which turned into a novel, and I decided to take some time to think about whether I wanted to write poetry or fiction. After bouncing around the country, I wound up back in Vermont, living in a cabin with no electricity, running water, or phone with my partner, Drea, while we built our own house. Over the years, I have been a house painter, farm worker, paste-up artist, Easter Bunny, pizza delivery person, homeless shelter staff member, and counselor for adults and kids with mental illness — I quit my last real job in 2000 to work on writing full time. In 2004, I gave birth to our daughter, Zella. These days, we’re living in an old Victorian in Montpelier, Vermont. Some neighbors think it looks like the Addams family house, which brings me immense pleasure."

9780061473067,"Michael Benson is one of today’s most popular true-crime writers. His books—including Betrayal In Blood, Murder In Connecticut, Killer Twins, The Burn Farm, Mommy Deadliest, A Killer’s Touch, Evil Season, and The Devil at Genesee Junction—tell vividly of today’s most heinous criminals, and the clever and stalwart lawmen who bring them to justice. He is currently a regular commentator for two true-crime series, Evil Twins and Evil Kin, on the Investigation Discovery (I.D.) channel, and had also made guest appearances on that channel’s Evil Stepmoms, Deadly Sins, Southern Fried Homicide, and On the Case with Paula Zahn. Benson’s most recent crime book, The Devil at Genesee Junction, tells the story of his return to the scene of a childhood trauma. Two of his friends were murdered and mutilated near his rural home south of Rochester, N.Y. when he was nine. Those murders were never solved. As an adult and veteran true-crime writer, Benson teamed up with the mother of one of the victims and a local private investigator to heat up that cold case and propel it in a startling new direction. During his three decades as a professional writer, Benson has worked closely with a retired Army Intelligence agent during the tense days after 9/11 for a book about the CIA, and with a retired FBI agent for a book about National Security; co-written two books with a former New York Police Department “Cop of the Year”; explored the Grassy Knoll in Dallas with a former KGB agent while researching his much-acclaimed Who’s Who in the JFK Assassination; collaborated efficiently with an astronaut; and covered the Stephen Hayes triple-murder trial in New Haven, Ct., for the New York Post. Benson has a B.A. with honors in Communication Arts from Hofstra University, and currently lives in Brooklyn, N.Y. He is the winner of an Academy of American Poets award.
Early reviews for THE DEVIL AT GENESEE JUNCTION:
Kathleen P. Munley
True crime author Michael Benson has written a deeply thoughtful and intriguing work of the horrific and unsolved murders of two young women from upstate New York that occurred some forty-nine years ago. A youngster at the time of the murders, the victims were neighbors of the author and their deaths deeply impacted his and the lives of the entire community. Written over an extended period of time, beginning in his youth, then in the 1980s and 1990s, and, finally, from 2011 to 2015, the author, in effect, reopens the case taking his readers on a protracted investigation into the crimes that includes consideration of ""likely suspects"" who got away with the murders. Along the route, readers are introduced to the people, places, and events that were the setting for the murders. The book is made even more interesting for the reader by the author's consideration of possible connections between the murders and those of others that occurred in various places in the United States around the same time. A really good read for all true crime buffs!
Patrick A. Patterson
Once again Mike Benson has documented a true crime event -- this time in his small, boyhood neighborhood in upstate New York during the late 1960s. He has created labyrinth of detail about the loss of innocents near a Tom Sawyer-like swimming hole where the death and sexual mutilation of two of his adolescent friends caused a frenzy and panic in the community. A crime that has never resulted in justice for the person or persons who committed the crime nor closure for the victim's families. Nearly fifty years later he describes the murders, the multitude of suspects developed and a community surrounded by pedophilia, rape and serial killers -- a story of sexual predators that makes us all fear for our children.
Robert Mladinich
Veteran crime writer Michael Benson embarks on a deeply personal and thought-provoking investigative journey into the murders of two young female neighbors nearly a half-century ago. Along with one of the victim's mothers and a private investigator, they leave no stone unturned in identifying suspects and linking them to other grisly killings throughout the United States. It's a page-turner.
Donald A. Tubman, Private Investigator
In 2011, I was offered the opportunity to be a large part of Michael Benson's investigation into the June 1966 murders of George-Ann Formicola and Kathy Bernhard, and jumped at the chance. I went to school with the victims, and graduated from high school on the evening of the murders, so I felt an emotional connection to the case. My many years as a policeman, investigator and now as a private investigator left me more than qualified for the task. The results of our investigation is now available to the public, expertly written by my friend and veteran true-crime writer, Michael Benson in the book The Devil at Genesee Junction. The book tells Benson's personal story, his close involvement with the tragedy, from the time he was nine-years-old to the present, almost 50 years later.The Devil at Genesee Junction is a must read as both a memoir and an investigatory procedural, for true-crime fans everywhere. Although the evidence against several suspects is analyzed in the book, one suspect in particular I feel necessitates increased scrutiny from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office's cold-case investigators. I believe that this case is solvable, and closure for Alice Bernhard, Kathy's mom, is possible. But action needs to be taken."

I've transformed my own struggle with thyroid disease into an advocacy campaign on behalf of patients with chronic diseases such as thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions, hormonal imbalances, and weight gain, among others.
I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis in 1995, and now research and write about these conditions and their impact on health and weight. I am a Patient Expert at HealthCentral.com, writing on Thyroid and Diabetes. For 20 years, I was Thyroid Expert for the Verywell.com Thyroid site (formerly About.com). 
I am editor of my popular patient thyroid news report, Sticking Out Our Necks, and the co-star in the Healthy Hormones series of programs on PBS. I also blog at the Huffington Post. 
In my patient advocacy role, I bring much-needed attention to underdiagnosed and often overlooked health issues. My desire to cut through medical jargon and deliver information to my fellow patients in a form they can understand resulted in my first health-related book, Living Well With Hypothyroidism: What Your Doctor Doesn't Tell You . . . That You Need to Know, which was first published in 2000 by HarperCollins, and has gone to more than 20 printings before a 2nd Revised Edition was published. The book was a Prevention Book Club Selection, and Amazon Top-Selling health book, and its popularity launched a new series of consumer health books for publisher HarperCollins.
I am also author of the New York Times best-selling book The Thyroid Diet: Manage Your Metabolism for Lasting Weight Loss. (2004) ""Thyroid Diet"" was also a semi-finalist for the prestigious Quills Awards in 2005. The newest edition of this popular book is The Thyroid Diet Revolution.
My latest books are ""Hair Loss Master Plan"" (with internationally renowned hair stylist and hair loss expert Brent Hardgrave), Your Healthy Pregnancy with Thyroid Disease"" (with HypothyroidMom's Dana Trentini), and ""Quinoa Mac and Cheese"" (with Brigitte Britton and Lisa Moretti). I am also author of Living Well With Graves' Disease and Hyperthyroidism, Living Well With Autoimmune Disease, Living Well With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia,"" (2004), Thyroid Hormone Breakthrough (2005), The Menopause Thyroid Solution, The Thyroid Diet Revolution, and the Thyroid Guide to Hair Loss. 
I've been featured in hundreds of television, radio, newspaper, magazine and web interviews, including appearances on ABC World News Tonight and CBS Radio Networks, and interviews in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Ladies Home Journal, Health, Cooking Light, Elle Magazine, Woman's World, and the Los Angeles Times, to name just a few. My goal? To help raise awareness for overlooked and mistreated thyroid and hormonal health issues.
Coaching: I also provide one-on-one personal telephone coaching to help fast-forward you up the learning curve and brainstorm answers to your health questions. Visit http://www.mary-shomon.com/coaching for more information.
In more than two decades of consumer advocacy, I have never hesitated to take a stand on behalf of patients, and my independence from drug companies and medical/patient organizations that are funded by the pharmaceutical industry has allowed me to maintain an unbiased, truly patient-first advocacy effort.

9780062079978,"In a career spanning more than seventy years, Ray Bradbury, who died on June 5, 2012, at the age of 91, inspired generations of readers to dream, think, and create. A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include Fahrenheit 451, The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, Dandelion Wine, and Something Wicked This Way Comes. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of Moby Dick, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's The Ray Bradbury Theater, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of The Halloween Tree. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.
Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, ""Live forever!"" Bradbury later said, ""I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."""

9780060095574,"Huston Cummings Smith (born May 31, 1919) is among the preeminent religious studies scholars in the United States. His work, The Religions of Man (later revised and retitled The World's Religions), is a classic in the field, with over two million copies sold, and it remains a common introduction to comparative religion.
Smith was born in Soochow, China, to Methodist missionaries and spent his first 17 years there. He taught at the Universities of Colorado and Denver from 1944 to 1947, moved to Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, for the next 10 years, and then served as professor of Philosophy at MIT from 1958 to 1973. While at MIT, he participated in some of the experiments with entheogens that professor Timothy Leary conducted at Harvard University. Smith then moved to Syracuse University, where he was Thomas J. Watson Professor of Religion and Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Philosophy until his retirement in 1983 and current emeritus status. He now lives in the Berkeley, California, area where he is Visiting Professor of Religious Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.
During his career, Smith not only studied but also practiced Vedanta Hinduism, Zen Buddhism (under Goto Zuigan), and Sufism for over 10 years each. He is a notable autodidact.
As a young man, of his own volition after suddenly turning to mysticism, Smith set out to meet with then-famous author Gerald Heard. Heard responded to Smith's letter, invited him to Trabuco College (later donated as the Ramakrishna Monastery) in Southern California, and then sent him off to meet the legendary Aldous Huxley. So began Smith's experimentation with meditation and his association with the Vedanta Society in Saint Louis under the auspices of Swami Satprakashananda of the Ramakrishna order.
Via the connection with Heard and Huxley, Smith eventually experimented with Timothy Leary and others at the Center for Personality Research, of which Leary was research professor. The experience and history of that era are captured somewhat in Smith's book Cleansing the Doors of Perception. In this period, Smith joined in on the Harvard Project as well, in an attempt to raise spiritual awareness through entheogenic plants. 
He has been a friend of the XIVth Dalai Lama for more than 40 years, and has met and talked to some of the great figures of the century, from Eleanor Roosevelt to Thomas Merton.
Smith developed an interest in the Traditionalist School formulated by Rene Guenon and Ananda Coomaraswamy. This interest has become a continuing thread in all his writings.
In 1996 Bill Moyers devoted a five-part PBS special to Smith's life and work: The Wisdom of Faith with Huston Smith. Smith has also produced three series for public television: The Religions of Man, The Search for America, and (with Arthur Compton) Science and Human Responsibility.
His films on Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, and Sufism have all won awards at international film festivals. His latest DVD release is The Roots of Fundamentalism—A Conversation with Huston Smith and Phil Cousineau."

I was inspired by personal history -- my dad was a U.S. Navy officer during the War and never talked much about it. These books are in part a quest to understand what the war was like for the young men and women who faced danger and an uncertain future.

 MACARTHUR'S SPIES: An American singer caught in the Philippines at the start of World War II spies on Japanese officers from her sultry Manila night club.
My most recent book, written with Michael D'Antonio, is a departure, back to my journalist roots. Why: I'm still in search of patriotism and basic decency. We live in dangerous times.
Have a look: The Shadow President, The Truth About Mike Pence. Available from Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martins.
A Kirkus starred review:
""Award-winning, veteran journalists collaborate on a well-researched and moderately toned yet searing biography of Vice President Mike Pence (b. 1959) ... Producing a biography of a living, controversial politician is always difficult. D’Antonio and Eisner have succeeded in this well-documented, damning book. Cue the outrage from Sean Hannity et al."""

9780060099435,"When I was child, bookstores and libraries were sanctuaries, my invitation to adventure, escape, satisfaction. Wanting to be a part of the action, I wrote my first ‘novel’ when I was six. Years later, my first real book arrived in bookstores.
But it’s taken me until my fifth novel to tackle a topic that’s always called to me: women in science. My mother was trained as a biochemist at the University of Chicago during World War II, and remained at the University afterwards, researching cures for cancer. But as was typical in that era, when she married, she gave up her career to be a wife. She spent the rest of her life aching for science. As a result, science flowed into her cooking, cleaning, our healthcare. She measured, she weighed, she considered, she hypothesized.
My mother’s best friend was her cousin Jean. Walking together to campus each day, they discussed everything. But no matter how many times she asked, Jean refused to tell my mother a single detail about what was going on at the ‘Metallurgical Laboratory’ where she worked. As it turns out, Jean was a clerical worker for the Manhattan Project and stayed true to her oath of secrecy until long after the atom bomb was dropped.
That story of silence stuck with me. And my research revealed there was one female physicist involved in those early Chicago years of the Manhattan Project: Leona Woods, the youngest member of the team. Atomic Love is in no way based on Woods’ life. Still, her presence at that critical time and place in history allowed me to create my main character, Rosalind Porter, a female physicist who is asked to risk love and limb to protect her country.
Adventure. Escape. Satisfaction. I hope you will find these things and more in Atomic Love.

I spent 1965 to 1967 in Liberia, West Africa, as a Peace Corps volunteer, graduated from New York University School of Law in 1970 as a night student. I went nights and worked as a junior high teacher in the South Bronx to support myself. My first job following law school was a clerkship with Herbert M. Schwab, the chief judge of the Oregon Court of Appeals, and from 1972 until 1996, I was in private practice, specializing in criminal defense at the trial and appellate levels. As an appellate attorney I have appeared before the United States Supreme Court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Oregon Supreme Court, and the Oregon Court of Appeals. As a trial attorney, I handled all sorts of criminal cases in state and federal court, and have represented approximately thirty people charged with homicide, several of whom faced the death penalty. I was the first Oregon attorney to use battered women's syndrome to defend a woman accused of murdering her spouse.
Since 1996, I have been writing full-time. All of my novels have been bestsellers. Heartstone, my first novel, was nominated by the Mystery Writers of America for an Edgar for best original paperback mystery of 1978.

Also in October, the short story ""The Case of the Purloined Paget,"" which I wrote with my brother, Jerry, will be published by Random House in the anthology A Study in Sherlock.

Her first collection, A Street in Bronzeville (1945), was greeted with critical acclaim and a Guggenheim fellowship. Annie Allen (1949) won the Pulitzer Prize in 1950, making her the first Black person to ever claim that honor. Her only novel, Maud Martha, was published in 1953. In The Mecca (1968) was nominated for the National Book Award, the same year she was appointed Poet Laureate of Illinois, a position she held until her death in 2000. Ms. Brooks was not only an active participant in the Black arts movement of the 60s and 70s she was also a role model. Never more so than when she left a major international House in the late 1960s to join Broadside Press, an up-and-coming Black publishing company. In 1976, she became the first Black woman inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters; and in 1985, the first to become Library of Congress Consultant in Poetry. She also published two volumes of autobiography, books for children, and won a National Endowment for the Arts Lifetime Achievement Award. Throughout her life, she taught young writers and held numerous academic posts - she was awarded over seventy honorary degrees - and became a professor of English at Chicago State University in 1990 until her death in 2000.
In 1939, Brooks married Henry Lowington Blakely, Jr. (author of  ""Windy Place""), whom she met after joining Chicago's NAACP Youth Council. They had two children: Nora Brooks Blakely, authorpreneur and president of Brooks Permissions in Chicago, and Henry Blakely III, a web designer & digital artist.

""I loved to read, and I found out during middle school that I loved to write just as much."" With the encouragement of two teachers, she decided to study journalism, although she did not have the drive to be a reporter that many of her classmates had. ""Yet in a way, journalism was the perfect choice for me, because I was terribly shy. Having to interview people for class assignments was the motivation I needed -- get over your shyness or fail the class!""
Not long after graduation, she got a job working for educational publisher Silver Burdett Ginn. There she learned a great deal about writing for children as she read excellent examples of children's literature that were used in the company's basal reading program. During this time, she published her first article for children, a piece about the Burgess Shale fossils for The Dolphin Log.
Since then, Fran has written more than 20 books for young readers. In fall 2014, The Secret Galaxy was published by Tilbury House Publishers; it went on to become a Junior Library Guild selection and part of the Bank Street Best Books for Children list. In summer 2015, Little Loon was published by Down East Books. In fall 2015, Fran's first novel, a middle-grade animal adventure in the spirit of Watership Down and the Warriors series, was published by Brattle Publishing in 2015.
