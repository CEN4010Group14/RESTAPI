I was one of those kids who talked all the time in class. I loved telling stories. One day in the 4th Grade, my teacher said, “You tell such good stories, maybe you should try writing some of them down.” “Wow,” I thought. “She thinks my stories are good.” That’s when I started to really enjoy writing.
I was also the class artist. When I wasn’t talking, I was drawing. When I was older, I studied art at the Rhode Island School of Design. That’s where I became interested in visual learning—how we decode and acquire information from graphs, charts, diagrams, models, illustrations and other images.
I became especially interested in educational publishing and have worked on the development of over a dozen major textbook programs, championing visual learning strategies from Pre-K through high school in every major curriculum area.
MATHSTART (mathstart.net) 
The inspiration to write math stories for children was sparked by my work on a high school mathematics program. Visual learning strategies helped teens, who had been characterized as “reluctant learners,” understand difficult math concepts. Putting math in the context of stories based on their experiences made them feel more comfortable with abstract concepts. They actually became eager to apply math to real-life problems.
If this approach worked for older students, I began to wonder what might happen if younger children were introduced to math this way!
Even before children can read - or speak many words - they can interpret visual information with ease. The MathStart books (HarperCollins) use simple stories coupled with diagrams, graphs and other visual models to teach everything from probability and pattern recognition to area, capacity and negative numbers.
The Best Bug Parade, (comparing sizes) was my very first published book. It was absolutely thrilling to see my name in print! I never expected that one day there would 63 MathStart books, split over three levels for ages Pre-K to Grade 4.
Each book includes two pages of review and activities designed to help teachers and parents extend learning beyond the story, along with suggestions of related books by other authors. After all, if a child enjoys learning math through stories, then let’s have more stories!
THE MAIN STREET KIDS CLUB: A MATHSTART MUSICAL (MainStreetKidsClub.com) 
Now get out your dancing shoes–there is a musical based on six of the MathStart books! The Main Street Kids’ Club, was workshopped at Northwestern University and adapted by Scott Ferguson, who also created the perennially popular production of School House Rock Live!
The songs are terrific. The math is spot on. And the club motto makes my heart sing: “Math Skills are Life Skills!”
I SEE I LEARN (iseeilearn.com)
My latest series of books is focused on young children—Preschool and Kindergarten age.
I See I Learn books (Charlesbridge) teach social, emotional, health and safety, and cognitive skills, such as how to make friends, build confidence, play safely, work together, manage emotions, and make plans. These skills are important for school readiness and for living happy, healthy, productive lives.
The stories “star” a wonderful bunch of friends who live in See-and-Learn City and attend Ready Set Pre-K. The cast includes Freda, Percy, Emma, Ajay, Camille, and Carlos. And, of course, Pickle, the green bull dog—who happens to have a soft-spot for butterflies—and Miss Cathy, their teacher.
I See I Learn stories are modeled on real-life situations and, just as in real-life, often involve more than one skill. For example, Freda Plans a Picnic is about sequencing, a cognitive skill, but the picnic itself is a social event. Percy Plays It Safe focuses on playground safety skills, but playing successfully in a group also requires self-regulation, an emotional skill.
Each book is reviewed by a team of experts, whose backgrounds include early childhood education, cognitive psychology and children’s museums. The stories are also developed to align with and support Core Curriculum State Standards.
Each I See I Learn book includes a special two-page section called A Closer Look, designed to help parents, teachers and caregivers review key points with their children.
WHERE STORIES COME FROM
People always ask me how I come up with my stories. The answer is simple: I talk to a lot of children! I have particularly close relationships with three of the characters in my books: Jack from MathStart's Jack the Builder, Maddie of Mighty Maddie and I See I Learn's Camille, are named after my grandchildren. No matter how big the real Jack, Maddie, and Camille grow to be, I can always pick up a book and see them flying a spaceship, wearing a pretty super-hero cape and building a sand castle at the beach with friends.

He has received the Story Prize, both the Rea Award and PEN/Malamud Award for excellence in the short story, the Los Angeles Times Book Award, and the PEN/Faulkner Award."
9780060511166,"The late Peggy Parish, well known for her stories about Amelia Bedelia, wrote many popular books for children, including Dinosaur Time, illustrated by Arnold Lobel. 
""I hate reading but your books are changing my opinion."" This letter, from a young Peggy Parish fan, comes as no surprise to the teachers and librarians who have put her books in the hands of children over the years. Ms. Parish wrote nearly three dozen children's books-many of which include her most famous character, the literal-minded maid named Amelia Bedelia.
Peggy Parish knew what children like to read. After graduating from the University of South Carolina with a degree in English, she taught school in Oklahoma, Kentucky, and, for over 15 years, at the well-known, progressive Dalton School in New York City. It was at Dalton that she began to find ways to release her creative ideas and energy, Though she never took a writing course, ""writing stories for children came naturally."" Her first book, published in 1961, was followed with Let's Be Indians and in 1963 with her unforgettable Amelia Bedelia.
Always involved with education in some way, Peggy Parish did television pieces on preschool education and children's books, wrote children's book review columns, and led numerous in-service training workshops for teachers. In discussing her ideas about education, she said, ""Children's rights are taken away from them when they enter school. What I try to show teachers is that all the skills needed to read can be taught outside of textbooks. Today's children are not going to read what they are not interested in. And if a positive attitude toward reading is not developed during the first three years of school, it is virtually impossible to develop it later.""
After living in New York for many years, Peggy Parish returned to her native South Carolina. She died in November, 1988. But Ameila Bedelia did not die. Peggy Parish's nephew, Herman Parish, has written Good Driving, Amelia Bedelia and Bravo, Amelia Bedelia!, published by Greenwillow Books in 1995 and 1997 respectively."

His best-known work, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, has eaten its way into the hearts of literally millions of children all over the world and has been translated into more than 62 languages and sold over 41 million copies. Since the Caterpillar was published in 1969, Eric Carle has illustrated more than 70 books, many best sellers, most of which he also wrote.
Carle says: ""With many of my books I attempt to bridge the gap between the home and school. To me home represents, or should represent; warmth, security, toys, holding hands, being held. School is a strange and new place for a child. Will it be a happy place? There are new people, a teacher, classmates - will they be friendly? I believe the passage from home to school is the second biggest trauma of childhood; the first is, of course, being born. Indeed, in both cases we leave a place of warmth and protection for one that is unknown. The unknown often brings fear with it. In my books I try to counteract this fear, to replace it with a positive message. I believe that children are naturally creative and eager to learn. I want to show them that learning is really both fascinating and fun.""
Eric Carle has two grown-up children, a son and a daughter. He divides his time between the Florida Keys and the hills of North Carolina.

Her dad was nature loving and her mum was very encouraging and warm. The nearby country lane with its many cottages was somewhere Georgia first found out about characters, for it was teeming with them, and she used to interview them. Otherwise she would try to sell these neighbours things she had made. As a child she loved acting and so at 18 went to The Central School of Speech and Drama in London. After college she began to paint and write. She had always written poems and songs but now she started writing stories. Her first were in comic strip, a medium that she worked with for five years. The Sock Monsters was her first published book in 1995 - a comic strip story for 5 - 7 year olds. Georgia lives in a house in London full of old and new art, as her husband is the conceptual artist Marc Quinn. Marc keeps all sorts of strange things in the fridge - once he had to keep a Canadian frog in there as it was hibernating and had to be kept cold. They and their family, Tiger (17), Lucas (6) and Sky (2) love to travel, their favorite destination being India."

9780060566760,"I was born in the hamlet of Dickinson, Alabama, which has a population of around 400 and is about half-white, half-black. I attended Dickinson Baptist Church for a while. I grew up a nonhunter in a hunting household, and I liked writing, drawing, and reading. I am the first member of my family to finish college. 
When I turned 18, we moved to Mobile, and my father, a mechanic, opened a shop there. I went to the University of South Alabama, but I got such bad grades that my father told me he wasn't going to pay anymore. From there, I got jobs in a warehouse, at a plant that made sandblasting grit, and finally with an engineering firm, which sent me to a chemical plant where I spent years cleaning up hazardous waste. All through these jobs, I took classes at the University of South Alabama, paying my own tuition as I went, and finally discovering creative writing classes. I worked in my late twenties, finishing my BA and beginning my MA, in a hospital in Mobile, and also tutoring in the university's writing lab. From there, I got a job teaching at Selma University, an historical all-black Baptist college. I was neither black nor Baptist (not anymore) and was, usually, the only white person on campus. I taught six classes one semester, six different classes, and five the next. I also finished my comprehensive exams for my MA, finished my thesis (a short story collection), and worked on my foreign language proficiency exam. 
I'd published a few short stories and won third prize in the Playboy College Fiction Contest (around 1991), and so I decided to pursue writing as a career. I applied to several MFA programs and wound up, fortunately, at the University of Arkansas. There I met my wife, poet Beth Ann Fennelly. We got married at the end of that four-year-long program, and around the same time, I sold my first book, Poachers, and the idea for Hell at the Breech, to William Morrow. We lived apart that first year of marriage—it was hard getting teaching jobs in the same city—but moved to Galesburg, Illinois, where my wife got a job teaching at Knox College. I won the Philip Roth Residency at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, and moved there for one semester. After that, we decided no more living apart. 
I taught at Knox for a year, during which we had our first child, Claire. Then I was offered the John and Renee Grisham Chair in Creative Writing in Oxford, Mississippi. We moved there, planning to return to Galesburg, but never have. Beth Ann was offered a job at Ole Miss, and they named me an ongoing writer-in-residence—and there we remain to this day. Our second child, Thomas Gerald Franklin III (I'm Junior) was born in Oxford in 2005. We love Oxford and hope never to leave."

9780064432092,"For more than forty years, the books Maurice Sendak has written and illustrated have nurtured children and adults alike and have challenged established ideas about what children's literature is and should be. The New York Times has recognized that Sendak's work “has brought a new dimension to the American children's book and has helped to change how people visualize childhood.” Parenting recently described Sendak as “indisputably, the most revolutionary force in children's books.”
Winner of the 1964 Caldecott Medal for Where the Wild Things Are, in 1970 Sendak became the first American illustrator to receive the international Hans Christian Andersen Award, given in recognition of his entire body of work. In 1983, he received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award from the American Library Association, also given for his entire body of work.
Beginning in 1952, with A Hole Is to Dig by Ruth Krauss, Sendak's illustrations have enhanced many texts by other writers, including the Little Bear books by Else Holmelund Minarik, children's books by Isaac Bashevis Singer and Randall Jarrell, and The Juniper Tree and Other Tales from Grimm. Dear Mili, Sendak's interpretation of a newly discovered tale by Wilhelm Grimm, was published to extraordinary acclaim in 1988.
In addition to Where the Wild Things Are (1963), Sendak has both written and illustrated 
The Nutshell Library (1962), Higglety Pigglety Pop! (1967), In the Night Kitchen (1970), Outside Over There (1981), and, We Are All in the Dumps with Jack and Guy (1993). He also illustrated Swine Lake (1999), authored by James Marshall, Brundibar (2003), by Tony Kushner, Bears (2005), by Ruth Krauss and, Mommy? (2006), his first pop-up book, with paper engineering by Matthew Reinhart and story by Arthur Yorinks.
Since 1980, Sendak has designed the sets and costumes for highly regarded productions of Mozart's The Magic Flute and Idomeneo, Janacek's The Cunning Little Vixen, Prokofiev's 
The Love for Three Oranges, Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker, and Hans Krása's Brundibár. 
In 1997, Sendak received the National Medal of Arts from President Clinton.

9780061473067,"Michael Benson is one of today’s most popular true-crime writers. His books—including Betrayal In Blood, Murder In Connecticut, Killer Twins, The Burn Farm, Mommy Deadliest, A Killer’s Touch, Evil Season, and The Devil at Genesee Junction—tell vividly of today’s most heinous criminals, and the clever and stalwart lawmen who bring them to justice. He is currently a regular commentator for two true-crime series, Evil Twins and Evil Kin, on the Investigation Discovery (I.D.) channel, and had also made guest appearances on that channel’s Evil Stepmoms, Deadly Sins, Southern Fried Homicide, and On the Case with Paula Zahn. Benson’s most recent crime book, The Devil at Genesee Junction, tells the story of his return to the scene of a childhood trauma. Two of his friends were murdered and mutilated near his rural home south of Rochester, N.Y. when he was nine. Those murders were never solved. As an adult and veteran true-crime writer, Benson teamed up with the mother of one of the victims and a local private investigator to heat up that cold case and propel it in a startling new direction. During his three decades as a professional writer, Benson has worked closely with a retired Army Intelligence agent during the tense days after 9/11 for a book about the CIA, and with a retired FBI agent for a book about National Security; co-written two books with a former New York Police Department “Cop of the Year”; explored the Grassy Knoll in Dallas with a former KGB agent while researching his much-acclaimed Who’s Who in the JFK Assassination; collaborated efficiently with an astronaut; and covered the Stephen Hayes triple-murder trial in New Haven, Ct., for the New York Post. Benson has a B.A. with honors in Communication Arts from Hofstra University, and currently lives in Brooklyn, N.Y. He is the winner of an Academy of American Poets award.
Early reviews for THE DEVIL AT GENESEE JUNCTION:
Kathleen P. Munley
True crime author Michael Benson has written a deeply thoughtful and intriguing work of the horrific and unsolved murders of two young women from upstate New York that occurred some forty-nine years ago. A youngster at the time of the murders, the victims were neighbors of the author and their deaths deeply impacted his and the lives of the entire community. Written over an extended period of time, beginning in his youth, then in the 1980s and 1990s, and, finally, from 2011 to 2015, the author, in effect, reopens the case taking his readers on a protracted investigation into the crimes that includes consideration of ""likely suspects"" who got away with the murders. Along the route, readers are introduced to the people, places, and events that were the setting for the murders. The book is made even more interesting for the reader by the author's consideration of possible connections between the murders and those of others that occurred in various places in the United States around the same time. A really good read for all true crime buffs!
Patrick A. Patterson
Once again Mike Benson has documented a true crime event -- this time in his small, boyhood neighborhood in upstate New York during the late 1960s. He has created labyrinth of detail about the loss of innocents near a Tom Sawyer-like swimming hole where the death and sexual mutilation of two of his adolescent friends caused a frenzy and panic in the community. A crime that has never resulted in justice for the person or persons who committed the crime nor closure for the victim's families. Nearly fifty years later he describes the murders, the multitude of suspects developed and a community surrounded by pedophilia, rape and serial killers -- a story of sexual predators that makes us all fear for our children.
Robert Mladinich
Veteran crime writer Michael Benson embarks on a deeply personal and thought-provoking investigative journey into the murders of two young female neighbors nearly a half-century ago. Along with one of the victim's mothers and a private investigator, they leave no stone unturned in identifying suspects and linking them to other grisly killings throughout the United States. It's a page-turner.
Donald A. Tubman, Private Investigator
In 2011, I was offered the opportunity to be a large part of Michael Benson's investigation into the June 1966 murders of George-Ann Formicola and Kathy Bernhard, and jumped at the chance. I went to school with the victims, and graduated from high school on the evening of the murders, so I felt an emotional connection to the case. My many years as a policeman, investigator and now as a private investigator left me more than qualified for the task. The results of our investigation is now available to the public, expertly written by my friend and veteran true-crime writer, Michael Benson in the book The Devil at Genesee Junction. The book tells Benson's personal story, his close involvement with the tragedy, from the time he was nine-years-old to the present, almost 50 years later.The Devil at Genesee Junction is a must read as both a memoir and an investigatory procedural, for true-crime fans everywhere. Although the evidence against several suspects is analyzed in the book, one suspect in particular I feel necessitates increased scrutiny from the Monroe County Sheriff's Office's cold-case investigators. I believe that this case is solvable, and closure for Alice Bernhard, Kathy's mom, is possible. But action needs to be taken."

I've transformed my own struggle with thyroid disease into an advocacy campaign on behalf of patients with chronic diseases such as thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions, hormonal imbalances, and weight gain, among others.
I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis in 1995, and now research and write about these conditions and their impact on health and weight. I am a Patient Expert at HealthCentral.com, writing on Thyroid and Diabetes. For 20 years, I was Thyroid Expert for the Verywell.com Thyroid site (formerly About.com). 
I am editor of my popular patient thyroid news report, Sticking Out Our Necks, and the co-star in the Healthy Hormones series of programs on PBS. I also blog at the Huffington Post. 
In my patient advocacy role, I bring much-needed attention to underdiagnosed and often overlooked health issues. My desire to cut through medical jargon and deliver information to my fellow patients in a form they can understand resulted in my first health-related book, Living Well With Hypothyroidism: What Your Doctor Doesn't Tell You . . . That You Need to Know, which was first published in 2000 by HarperCollins, and has gone to more than 20 printings before a 2nd Revised Edition was published. The book was a Prevention Book Club Selection, and Amazon Top-Selling health book, and its popularity launched a new series of consumer health books for publisher HarperCollins.
I am also author of the New York Times best-selling book The Thyroid Diet: Manage Your Metabolism for Lasting Weight Loss. (2004) ""Thyroid Diet"" was also a semi-finalist for the prestigious Quills Awards in 2005. The newest edition of this popular book is The Thyroid Diet Revolution.
My latest books are ""Hair Loss Master Plan"" (with internationally renowned hair stylist and hair loss expert Brent Hardgrave), Your Healthy Pregnancy with Thyroid Disease"" (with HypothyroidMom's Dana Trentini), and ""Quinoa Mac and Cheese"" (with Brigitte Britton and Lisa Moretti). I am also author of Living Well With Graves' Disease and Hyperthyroidism, Living Well With Autoimmune Disease, Living Well With Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia,"" (2004), Thyroid Hormone Breakthrough (2005), The Menopause Thyroid Solution, The Thyroid Diet Revolution, and the Thyroid Guide to Hair Loss. 
I've been featured in hundreds of television, radio, newspaper, magazine and web interviews, including appearances on ABC World News Tonight and CBS Radio Networks, and interviews in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Ladies Home Journal, Health, Cooking Light, Elle Magazine, Woman's World, and the Los Angeles Times, to name just a few. My goal? To help raise awareness for overlooked and mistreated thyroid and hormonal health issues.
Coaching: I also provide one-on-one personal telephone coaching to help fast-forward you up the learning curve and brainstorm answers to your health questions. Visit http://www.mary-shomon.com/coaching for more information.
In more than two decades of consumer advocacy, I have never hesitated to take a stand on behalf of patients, and my independence from drug companies and medical/patient organizations that are funded by the pharmaceutical industry has allowed me to maintain an unbiased, truly patient-first advocacy effort.

A prolific author of hundreds of short stories and close to fifty books, as well as numerous poems, essays, operas, plays, teleplays, and screenplays, Bradbury was one of the most celebrated writers of our time. His groundbreaking works include Fahrenheit 451, The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, Dandelion Wine, and Something Wicked This Way Comes. He wrote the screen play for John Huston's classic film adaptation of Moby Dick, and was nominated for an Academy Award. He adapted sixty-five of his stories for television's The Ray Bradbury Theater, and won an Emmy for his teleplay of The Halloween Tree. He was the recipient of the 2000 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2004 National Medal of Arts, and the 2007 Pulitzer Prize Special Citation, among many honors.
Throughout his life, Bradbury liked to recount the story of meeting a carnival magician, Mr. Electrico, in 1932. At the end of his performance Electrico reached out to the twelve-year-old Bradbury, touched the boy with his sword, and commanded, ""Live forever!"" Bradbury later said, ""I decided that was the greatest idea I had ever heard. I started writing every day. I never stopped."""

9780060009366,"When I was nine years old, I was the sickest I could ever remember: horrible sore throat, feverish, sick to my stomach. I felt like my body had been buried in the back of a garbage truck and obliterated into a crumble of mush. Soon after I came down with the symptoms, the family doctor gave me a shot. Within hours, I felt better. I felt good. I felt like myself. 
I know that I was only nine, but I can tell you very clearly that this was the moment I knew I wanted to be doctor. My little self said, “If I could help people feel better and make sick people healthy, wow, that’s what I want to do!” And I’ve never strayed from that goal: helping people get healthy to live life to its fullest.
And that’s what these books including , ""This Is Your Do-Over"", are about: helping you lose weight, live your passion, thrive in your relationships, and jump into life with energy and vitality – not just for more years, but for younger and fuller ones. 
I’ll take you through a mixture of information, strategies, inspirational stories, and hard data to give you all the essentials for taking control of your body and your health – no matter your genes, past health mistakes, or the number of times you've tried to tackle your health and failed. 
It’s time to forgive yourself. Living a vital life starts now: This Is Your Do-Over.
Now let me talk about the ""What To Eat When: A Strategic Plan To Improve Your Health and Life Thru Food"" Book. We were amazed at the new (in last two years) science that indicates WHEN you eat is as important as WHAT you eat to maximizing your health and weight loss. 
Now it is always concerning, exciting, and fun for me to have a new book coming out . Concerning cause I do not like asking people to spend money for a purpose that seems self serving so I have to remember what I am trying to do is change the health of the nation and thereby lower medical costs for all and make all more productive and suffer less disability.
Exciting cause I never know if the way we present the science will be engaging enough to get people to talk about the book and change behavior to get healthier. I always worry that we do not make the science reading that is usually boring in details interesting enough to keep people engaged. (Yes Ted Spiker makes the writing much more fun--I nearly flunked out of college due to my grade in freshman English--I may be one of the few people that like it that our publisher allowed me to put the references to the scientific studies in the back of the book again --yes they said it had to be in small print , but those refs are there for people to verify the science). 
And fun, cause I get to hear from old friends (and new friends who just read the book and email or write me) in emails and appreciate the friends --- so thanks for being a friend.. tell me (and any social media sites and amazon.com or BN.com or whomever) what you thought of it-- it is the only way we get to change behavior these days 
And Thanks for considering helping change the health of the country this way, Mike

9780060012236,"I am Brent Hartinger, a novelist and screenwriter. I’ve published fourteen novels, had nine screenplays optioned, and had two of my projects turned into feature films.
My first novel, GEOGRAPHY CLUB (2003), is the story of a gay teen named Russel Middlebrook. It was one of the first in a new wave of break-out LGBTQ young adult fiction, and it was adapted as a feature film in 2013. I subsequently wrote three more books about Russel, calling them The Russel Middlebrook Series. I tried to give these books a lot of humor and heart.
In 2013, I continued Russel’s story as he grew up, into his twenties, in a new, stand-alone series called Russel Middlebook: The Futon Years. These books are “new adult” (making Russel one of very few literary characters to “jump” genres in projects created by the same author). 
In 2017, I released a new, stand-alone series starring Russel’s gay disabled friend Otto Digmore, called The Otto Digmore Series.
I love mysteries and thrillers. My 2016 gay teen puzzle box thriller THREE TRUTHS AND A LIE was nominated for an Edgar Award (this, and my 2005 novel GRAND & HUMBLE, are real mind-benders, trust me). My 2007 YA mystery, PROJECT PAY DAY, is much lighter, and has also been adapted as feature film (which I wrote), to be released in 2020.
Here are all my books:
THE OTTO DIGMORE SERIES
* The Otto Digmore Difference (book 1)
* The Otto Digmore Decision (book 2)
RUSSEL MIDDLEBROOK: THE FUTON YEARS
* The Thing I Didn't Know I Didn't Know (book #1)
* Barefoot in the City of Broken Dreams (book #2)

* Geography Club (book #1)
* The Order of the Poison Oak (book #2)
* Double Feature: Attack of the Soul-Sucking Brain Zombies/Bride of the Soul-Sucking Brain Zombies (book #3)
* The Elephant of Surprise (book #4)
* Two Thousand Pounds Per Square Inch (a free short story)
MY OTHER BOOKS
* Project Pay Day

I also love to travel. In fact, I no longer have a home. Instead, I travel the world indefinitely with my husband, writer Michael Jensen, moving to a new country every few months. You can follow our ""digital nomad"" journey at BrentandMichaelAreGoingPlaces.com
I try hard to write books that are page-turners, and movies that are fast-paced and accessible. If I had to describe my own writing projects, I would say, “Strong central concept, strong plot, strong character and voice.”
Basically, I see myself as a storyteller. But I think “story” is a lot more than “beautiful language” or complicated camera angles, which I often find self-indulgent and distracting. In most cases, I think the important thing for a writer or filmmaker is to get out of the way and just tell the damn story.
I answer all questions, so feel free to contact me on social media, or through my website: BrentHartinger.com

The lovable, literal-minded housekeeper has been a member of his family ever since. Peggy Parish died in 1988. She would be proud and delighted to know that with Good Driving, Amelia Bedelia; Bravo, Amelia Bedelia!; Amelia Bedelia 4 Mayor and now Calling Doctor Amelia Bedelia, her nephew is carrying on -- for a new generation of readers -- the tradition she began years ago. 
In His Own Words... ""In true Amelia Bedelia fashion, I backed into writing these books about the literal-minded housekeeper who children laugh at and love. Amelia Bedelia was created by my aunt, Peggy Parish. Although she passed away in 1988, Peggy still received fan mail from children. They wondered when the next Amelia Bedelia book would be out. Then other children's authors wrote and volunteered to continue the series. I felt uneasy about Amelia Bedelia leaving our family. As I was in the fourth grade when she first appeared, I had literally grown up with her. So I decided to try to write a new Amelia Bedelia adventure. My two sisters and my family were very supportive and encouraged me. I'd had experience in writing advertisements. I reread the Amelia Bedelia stories to figure out what made them funny. I realized that everyday life overflows with idiomatic expressions, literalisms, and homophones. It's amazing more people don't get confused-besides Amelia Bedelia! My first book, Good Driving, Amelia Bedelia, took me a year to think about and one night to write. I had been collecting ideas, homonyms, and expressions. Whenever I heard them, I jotted them down: on napkins in restaurants, on my newspaper while riding the bus, and on agenda sheets in business meetings.
I stockpiled these fragments in a folder until one Sunday night, with my family asleep, I decided that it was now or never. I sat down around ten o'clock and began to write. I was so focused on the story that I finished as the sun came up on Monday morning. Naturally, the story needed revision, but the essence was captured in that all-night writing spree.
I am fortunate that my editor, Susan Hirschman, and the illustrator, Lynn Sweat, had worked with Peggy on many Amelia Bedelia books. That helped make the transition from Peggy's books to mine as seamless as possible.
I feel very lucky to be writing Amelia Bedelia books and continuing a family tradition. But the best reward was when a child wrote Peggy Parish a fan letter. It said that Good Driving, Amelia Bedelia is the best book she has written. To me, that's the highest compliment I could hope for."""

What became a part of the marketing lexicon in the early '70's holds its own in the textbooks of today.""
