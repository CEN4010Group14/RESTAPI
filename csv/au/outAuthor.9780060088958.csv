Some of his bestsellers include Road Dogs, Up in Honey’s Room, The Hot Kid, Mr. Paradise, Tishomingo Blues, and the critically acclaimed collection of short stories Fire in the Hole. Many of his books have been made into movies, including Get Shorty, Out of Sight, and Rum Punch, which became Quentin Tarantino’s Jackie Brown. Justified, the hit series from FX, is based on Leonard’s character Raylan Givens, who appears in Riding the Rap, Pronto, Raylan and the short story “Fire in the Hole”.

9780060086121,"When I was nine years old, I was the sickest I could ever remember: horrible sore throat, feverish, sick to my stomach. I felt like my body had been buried in the back of a garbage truck and obliterated into a crumble of mush. Soon after I came down with the symptoms, the family doctor gave me a shot. Within hours, I felt better. I felt good. I felt like myself. I know that I was only nine, but I can tell you very clearly that this was the moment I knew I wanted to be doctor. My little self said, “If I could help people feel better and make sick people healthy, wow, that’s what I want to do!” And I’ve never strayed from that goal: helping people get healthy to live life to its fullest.And that’s what these books including , ""This Is Your Do-Over"", are about: helping you lose weight, live your passion, thrive in your relationships, and jump into life with energy and vitality – not just for more years, but for younger and fuller ones. I’ll take you through a mixture of information, strategies, inspirational stories, and hard data to give you all the essentials for taking control of your body and your health – no matter your genes, past health mistakes, or the number of times you've tried to tackle your health and failed. It’s time to forgive yourself. Living a vital life starts now: This Is Your Do-Over.Now let me talk about the ""What To Eat When: A Strategic Plan To Improve Your Health and Life Thru Food"" Book. We were amazed at the new (in last two years) science that indicates WHEN you eat is as important as WHAT you eat to maximizing your health and weight loss. Now it is always concerning, exciting, and fun for me to have a new book coming out . Concerning cause I do not like asking people to spend money for a purpose that seems self serving so I have to remember what I am trying to do is change the health of the nation and thereby lower medical costs for all and make all more productive and suffer less disability.Exciting cause I never know if the way we present the science will be engaging enough to get people to talk about the book and change behavior to get healthier. I always worry that we do not make the science reading that is usually boring in details interesting enough to keep people engaged. (Yes Ted Spiker makes the writing much more fun--I nearly flunked out of college due to my grade in freshman English--I may be one of the few people that like it that our publisher allowed me to put the references to the scientific studies in the back of the book again --yes they said it had to be in small print , but those refs are there for people to verify the science). And fun, cause I get to hear from old friends (and new friends who just read the book and email or write me) in emails and appreciate the friends --- so thanks for being a friend.. tell me (and any social media sites and amazon.com or BN.com or whomever) what you thought of it-- it is the only way we get to change behavior these days And Thanks for considering helping change the health of the country this way, Mike MICHAEL F.

He spent ten years at sea working as a professional captain and has taught creative writing at Georgetown University. NYU in Paris, Bowdoin College. He currently teaches in the MFA program at Antioch University Los Angeles.""Not an unswerving literary trajectory. I've wanted to write - and to be a writer - since childhood. In my 20s I worked at writerly jobs in advertising and journalism while I wrote two unpublished novels. Then I stepped aboard a friend's yacht and my life swung away toward boats and the sea for a decade. I became, in turn, a boat bum, a U.S. Coast Guard-licensed commercial captain, and a proficient navigator with sextant. Then the leaky 27-foot, engineless wooden sailboat that had been my home for 5 years, in which I'd twice crossed the Atlantic, sank near the end of my third crossing (I was alone). But I had found a subject.  I was rescued and crawled ashore in Los Angeles where, naturally, I began writing screenplays. I was fatally encouraged: I found agents and made a little money, but never saw my screenplays (they were full of leaky projects and rootless characters) turned into films. Unhappy with my screenwriting career (and my non-writing career of many jobs, including being a 'ship wrangler' in Borneo for a bad pirate movie), I fled LA to a shack in Northern California where I wrote what became a memoir of my years afloat and the twinned sinkings of my boat and first marriage (""Sea Change""). In the next ten years I published a novel and three more books of non-fiction - all about not so much the sea and sailors, but fringe characters who have retreated to the water's edge and have nowhere else to go. Being published changed everything. I went fairly quickly from being a yachtie, shepherd, carpenter, ship wrangler with literary delusions to a visiting professor of creative writing at some good colleges. I've been fortunate to have wonderful students. I love teaching because I can tell young writers what it took me decades to learn - simply, that yes, you can, if you really believe in yourself and don't give up. I dreamed of becoming a writer and I became one. And if I did it, they can too. My novel, ""The Rocks,"" (2015) is not about boats and the sea but represents a new direction for me as a writer of fiction. I hope there will be more non-boaty novels.""PN, 2015"
