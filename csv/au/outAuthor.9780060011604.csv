9780060008734,"Alexis-Charles-Henri Clérel de Tocqueville (French: [alɛksi ʃaʁl ɑ̃ʁi kleʁɛl də tɔkvil]; 29 July 1805 – 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science.Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830–48) and then during the Second Republic (1849–51) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoléon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution.He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.Bio from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

9780060009366,"When I was nine years old, I was the sickest I could ever remember: horrible sore throat, feverish, sick to my stomach. I felt like my body had been buried in the back of a garbage truck and obliterated into a crumble of mush. Soon after I came down with the symptoms, the family doctor gave me a shot. Within hours, I felt better. I felt good. I felt like myself. I know that I was only nine, but I can tell you very clearly that this was the moment I knew I wanted to be doctor. My little self said, “If I could help people feel better and make sick people healthy, wow, that’s what I want to do!” And I’ve never strayed from that goal: helping people get healthy to live life to its fullest.And that’s what these books including , ""This Is Your Do-Over"", are about: helping you lose weight, live your passion, thrive in your relationships, and jump into life with energy and vitality – not just for more years, but for younger and fuller ones. I’ll take you through a mixture of information, strategies, inspirational stories, and hard data to give you all the essentials for taking control of your body and your health – no matter your genes, past health mistakes, or the number of times you've tried to tackle your health and failed. It’s time to forgive yourself. Living a vital life starts now: This Is Your Do-Over.Now let me talk about the ""What To Eat When: A Strategic Plan To Improve Your Health and Life Thru Food"" Book. We were amazed at the new (in last two years) science that indicates WHEN you eat is as important as WHAT you eat to maximizing your health and weight loss. Now it is always concerning, exciting, and fun for me to have a new book coming out . Concerning cause I do not like asking people to spend money for a purpose that seems self serving so I have to remember what I am trying to do is change the health of the nation and thereby lower medical costs for all and make all more productive and suffer less disability.Exciting cause I never know if the way we present the science will be engaging enough to get people to talk about the book and change behavior to get healthier. I always worry that we do not make the science reading that is usually boring in details interesting enough to keep people engaged. (Yes Ted Spiker makes the writing much more fun--I nearly flunked out of college due to my grade in freshman English--I may be one of the few people that like it that our publisher allowed me to put the references to the scientific studies in the back of the book again --yes they said it had to be in small print , but those refs are there for people to verify the science). And fun, cause I get to hear from old friends (and new friends who just read the book and email or write me) in emails and appreciate the friends --- so thanks for being a friend.. tell me (and any social media sites and amazon.com or BN.com or whomever) what you thought of it-- it is the only way we get to change behavior these days And Thanks for considering helping change the health of the country this way, Mike MICHAEL F.
